      <h2>Teacher's Corner</h2>
      <img src="/assets/images/teachers/kara-kernan.jpg" class="picture teacher" alt="Picture of Kara" />
      <p>
        Kara has been a yoga student for over 10 years. In March of 2015, she decided to deepen her own personal practice by enrolling in yoga teacher training through Schoolhouse Yoga. This decision has ignited a passion within her to share her love of yoga with others. Prior to becoming a yoga instructor, Kara worked for many years within the social service field. She developed the skill of being able to hold space for others through her extensive experience as a social worker. She brings this skill to every one of her classes. The core philosophy of Kara’s classes is that everyone is capable to feel strong and empowered in their own bodies. Her classes focus on dynamic movements, breath work, and proper alignment in order to guide students down a path of self-discovery. Kara creates a supportive environment for students through clear, creative, compassionate and enthusiastic guidance.
        </p>
      <p>
        Kara teaches a Yoga 2 class on Monday evenings at 6:15pm at our <a href="/locations#eastliberty">East Liberty</a> schoool.

        <h3>Women's Healing Circle with Kendell Romanelli</h3>
        <img src="/assets/images/workshops/womenscircle.jpg" class="picture workshop" alt="Women's Circle photo'">
        <p>
          This class is designed to use the energy of yoga, mantra and meditation to heal the body, mind and soul. It is open to women of all ages and
          backgrounds. When we come together in a circle, the power of the group helps to support and uplift all the members of the group. We will begin
          class with some yoga exercises and stretches. We will then light a candle and speak an intention for healing in five words or less. We will
          support our intention by chanting a healing mantra and close with a deep relaxation supported by the healing power of guided meditation.

        <h3>The Body is a Pond: Lymphatic Self-Massage and Yoga With Julia Schandelmeier, LMT and Richard Gartner, ERYT</h3>
        <img src="/assets/images/workshops/lymphatic.jpg" class="picture workshop" alt="Richard teaching">       
        <p>
          What is our lymphatic system, why it is important to us, and how can we increase our own lymphatic flow? Richard Gartner, ERYT, and Julia Schandelmeier, LMT and certified lymphatic therapist, present this experiential and informative workshop about our fluid body. The lymph system is a series of rivers and channels that detoxes the body and aids digestion. This workshop is a guide to keep your lymph system moving and strong. You’ll learn the basics of the lymphatic system, a lymphatic massage routine and yoga postures that support your system. You'll also receive handouts you can take home and refer to at any time. This is an all-levels workshop that assumes a generally healthy lymphatic system. If you have any lymphatic or lymph node conditions, please contact us to see if this workshop is right for you.

        <h3>Moon Salutations with Kendell Romanelli</h3>
        <img src="/assets/images/workshops/moonsalutations.jpg" class="picture workshop" alt="Moon yoga">
        <p>
          Moon Salutations are a flowing yoga practice designed to draw the energy of the body, mind and heart, inward to a more
          reflective nature honoring the energy of the full moon. In this workshop we will combine the Moon Salutation sequence with
          mantras, meditations and restorative postures. We will use the practice of candle gazing and a guided deep relaxation to clear
          the mind and calm the soul. It is a time to heal and reflect on all the beauty within us and around us.

        <p>
          <b>Foundations of Ayurveda:</b> Nature will support our own natural rhythm when we live in alignment with it, helping us to stay healthy and to live optimally. When we live out of synch with this rhythm, we start to create disharmony within both the body and mind.  Come and learn how to create a daily routine, know as Dinacharya, to support and nourish your body and mind through a combination of self-care practices, nutrition, yoga and pranayama.  We'll end with a grounding asana practice specially made for balancing the body during this time of year.

        <p><b>Ayurvedic Spring Cleanse:</b> Spring is traditionally a time in Ayurveda to start to lighten the heaviness that has accumulated within the body and mind during the winter months by doing a cleanse. This three day cleanse will help you to feel lighter and more vibrant by stoking your Agni (inner fire) which stimulates digestion and metabolism, leaving you feeling re-energized and renewed.
