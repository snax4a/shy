        <h3>Moon Salutations with Kendell Romanelli</h3>
        <img src="/assets/images/workshops/moonsalutations.jpg" class="picture workshop" alt="Woman sitting with child">       
        <p>
          Moon Salutations were developed in the early 1980s by four women at Kripalu Institute to balance the energy of traditional Sun Salutations. Moon Salutes tune into the reflective, intuitive energy of the moon focusing on hip and heart opening postures. Each posture is held for several seconds in order to allow the body to accept the energy of the practice. It is a mixed level practice that builds stamina of the body and mind. This 90-minute workshop combines the beautiful flow of Moon Salutations with healing yoga exercises, chanting meditations, candle gazing and deep relaxation. The entire workshop is supported with live guitar music by Rick Romanelli. Each month follows the theme of the full moon for that month with slight variations to the Moon Salutation, mantra and music. A perfect way to end your work week!

        <p>
          In our family yoga workshop, we will focus on fun and playful movement as well as calming breath work to bring the family together
          in a lighthearted practice. We will move through a physical asana practice designed to be mindful of the bodies and minds of children
          and teenagers. Join us to unite your practice with your family as we include a brief guided meditation to help to focus busy minds
          of children and parents alike. Family members and friends of young yogis (ages 4 and over) are welcome.

        <h3>Teen Yoga Workshops with Bailey Zembower</h3>
        <img src="/assets/images/workshops/teenyoga.jpg" class="picture workshop" alt="Woman sitting with child">       
        <p>
          In our teen yoga workshop, we will focus on bringing peace and calm to the mind while getting to know our bodies. An introduction to meditation will be provided as it can be used to ground ourselves in stressful times and helps us to become more mindful of our world, our actions, and our words. This would be a great first yoga experience if you are looking to get into yoga or just a more comfortable way to practice and meet other teen yogis. Come build strength and flexibility and open your mind in a safe space with other like-minded teens!

        <h3>Supporting the Perimeter with Richard Gartner</h3>
        <img src="/assets/images/workshops/partnermeditation.jpg" class="picture workshop" alt="Joni seated">       
        <p>
          If you wish to further your practice by accessing your feet, hands, neck and face, this workshop is for you. A typical yoga practice focuses on a few major areas of the body like knees, hamstrings, or spine. This workshop spotlights micro-asanasâ€”practices for the overworked and often ignored parts of our selves. These practices are a boon for anyone with repetitive stress symptoms, tension headaches, sore feet, and anyone who wishes to deepen their yoga experience. Yoga Alliance members receive a digital certificate for 2.5 CE credit hours.

        <h3>Sitting is Killing me with Jill Clary</h3>
        <img src="/assets/images/workshops/officeyoga.jpg" class="picture workshop" alt="Getting Unstuck">
        <p>
          Do you sit at a keyboard for hours? Do you have tight hips, legs, or neck, shoulder and back pain? Camping out all day at a desk can also create an unhealthy posture: the back and shoulders hunch down and the neck protrudes forward - that you take with you when you leave for the day. Join Jill Clary, RYT, for a practice designed to relieve tension and lesson the chronic ache of office work. We'll start with a chair practice we can do while at our desk or on our commute, move to our mat for a floor practice concentrated on these key areas, and finish with restorative/yin poses to leave us feeling renewed and recharged.
