        <h3>Moon Salutations with Kendell Romanelli</h3>
        <img src="/assets/images/workshops/moonsalutations.jpg" class="picture workshop" alt="Woman sitting with child">       
        <p>
          Moon Salutations were developed in the early 1980s by four women at Kripalu Institute to balance the energy of traditional Sun Salutations. Moon Salutes tune into the reflective, intuitive energy of the moon focusing on hip and heart opening postures. Each posture is held for several seconds in order to allow the body to accept the energy of the practice. It is a mixed level practice that builds stamina of the body and mind. This 90-minute workshop combines the beautiful flow of Moon Salutations with healing yoga exercises, chanting meditations, candle gazing and deep relaxation. The entire workshop is supported with live guitar music by Rick Romanelli. Each month follows the theme of the full moon for that month with slight variations to the Moon Salutation, mantra and music. A perfect way to end your work week!

        <p>
          If you wish to further your practice by accessing your feet, hands, neck and face, this workshop is for you. A typical yoga practice focuses on a few major areas of the body like knees, hamstrings, or spine. This workshop spotlights micro-asanasâ€”practices for the overworked and often ignored parts of our selves. These practices are a boon for anyone with repetitive stress symptoms, tension headaches, sore feet, and anyone who wishes to deepen their yoga experience. Yoga Alliance members receive a digital certificate for 2.5 CE credit hours.

        <img src="/assets/images/workshops/neuroscience.jpg" class="picture workshop" alt="Neuroscience">
        <p>
          Presenters: Paul D. Nussbaum, Ph.D., ABPP; Linda Meacci, E-RYT; and Paula Soto, LSW, E-RYT. Yogis and mental health professionals will benefit from this collaborative workshop connecting neuroscience and therapeutically oriented yoga. Dr. Paul Nussbaum, founder and president of Brain Health Center, Inc., in Wexford, PA, and adjunct professor in Neurological Surgery at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, is board-certified in Clinical Psychology and Geropsychology with a specialization in Neuropsychology. Dr. Nussbaum will address basic neuroanatomy of the human brain and provide an overview of the relationships between brain regions and human behaviors. Participants will learn about neural plasticity, neurogenesis and the neural networks that underlie cognition, movement and emotion, with particular emphasis on regions of the brain that help facilitate internal wellbeing and emotional balance. Linda Meacci and Paula Soto will present an experiential yoga practice to illustrate how yoga impacts the function and health of the human brain. Continuing education credits can be earned.

          In our family yoga workshop, we will focus on fun and playful movement as well as calming breath work to bring the family together
          in a lighthearted practice. We will move through a physical asana practice designed to be mindful of the bodies and minds of children
          and teenagers. Join us to unite your practice with your family as we include a brief guided meditation to help to focus busy minds
          of children and parents alike. Family members and friends of young yogis (ages 4 and over) are welcome.

        <h3>Teen Yoga Workshops with Bailey Zembower</h3>
        <img src="/assets/images/workshops/teenyoga.jpg" class="picture workshop" alt="Woman sitting with child">       
        <p>
          In our teen yoga workshop, we will focus on bringing peace and calm to the mind while getting to know our bodies. An introduction to meditation will be provided as it can be used to ground ourselves in stressful times and helps us to become more mindful of our world, our actions, and our words. This would be a great first yoga experience if you are looking to get into yoga or just a more comfortable way to practice and meet other teen yogis. Come build strength and flexibility and open your mind in a safe space with other like-minded teens!

        <h3>Straight from the Shoulder with Richard Gartner</h3>
        <img src="/assets/images/workshops/shoulder.jpg" class="picture workshop" alt="Shoulder">
        <p>
          This all-levels workshop explores ways to strengthen the upper body safely and develop a sense of security in the shoulders and arms. Part anatomy lesson, part practice, this workshop is a boon for yogis who have experienced rotator cuff or elbow injuries. Richard reviews the muscular anatomy of the upper body. He then guides students through long holds and dynamic exercises. Using common poses, students gain insight into their shoulder and arm positions and develop strength. Students should be able to bear some weight on their hands, and their wrists should be free of recent injury. Yoga Alliance members receive a digital certificate for 2.5 CE credit hours.
