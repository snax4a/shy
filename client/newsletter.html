        <h3>Women's Healing Circle with Kendell Romanelli</h3>
        <img src="/assets/images/workshops/womenscircle.jpg" class="picture workshop" alt="Women's Circle photo'">
        <p>
          This class is designed to use the energy of yoga, mantra and meditation to heal the body, mind and soul. It is open to women of all ages and
          backgrounds. When we come together in a circle, the power of the group helps to support and uplift all the members of the group. We will begin
          class with some yoga exercises and stretches. We will then light a candle and speak an intention for healing in five words or less. We will
          support our intention by chanting a healing mantra and close with a deep relaxation supported by the healing power of guided meditation.

        <h3>Moon Salutations with Kendell Romanelli</h3>
        <img src="/assets/images/workshops/moonsalutations.jpg" class="picture workshop" alt="Moon yoga">
        <p>
          Moon Salutations are a flowing yoga practice designed to draw the energy of the body, mind and heart, inward to a more
          reflective nature honoring the energy of the full moon. In this workshop we will combine the Moon Salutation sequence with
          mantras, meditations and restorative postures. We will use the practice of candle gazing and a guided deep relaxation to clear
          the mind and calm the soul. It is a time to heal and reflect on all the beauty within us and around us.
