		"description": "Moon Salutations were developed in the early 1980s by four women at Kripalu Institute to balance the energy of traditional Sun Salutations. Moon Salutes tune into the reflective, intuitive energy of the moon focusing on hip and heart opening postures. Each posture is held for several seconds in order to allow the body to accept the energy of the practice. It is a mixed-level practice that builds stamina of the body and mind. This 90-minute workshop combines the beautiful flow of Moon Salutations with healing yoga exercises, chanting meditations, candle gazing and deep relaxation. The entire workshop is supported with live guitar music by Rick Romanelli. A perfect way to end your work week!",

Fully supported postures encourage the body to rest, relax, release away from uncomfortable holding patterns, and restore. Relaxation in the physical body encourages deeper, more relaxed and efficient breathing, which in turn promotes ease of mind. Restorative yoga does have challenges, too â€“ relaxing isn't always so easy, and letting go of our busy thoughts can be difficult. This is where the lullabies come in. Music is medicine: it stimulates the energy centers of the body, resonates all the cells in the body, and connects with the soul. Presenting a carefully curated set of lullabies, Kendell's enchanting vocals, supported by Rick Romanelli on guitar, are sure to bring you deeper into your restorative practice.",

				"title": "Sthira Sukham Asanam â€“ Yoga Sutra II.46: What does a yoga assist do? It takes the existing sthira and sukha qualities in the studentâ€™s body and mind, and enhances them. This is done non-verbally, which can often be a more direct form of communication. The teacher must first establish these qualities in him/herself in order to transmit them to the student. Good adjustments start with a solid asana practice on the part of the teacher. The same qualities that create a good personal asana create a good assist. We will learn how to cultivate these qualities both individually and in relation to others, applying specific exercises directly to hands on assists in a variety of common poses.",

By juxtaposing the similar poses, we can gain deeper insight into the underlying principles at work, and how to overcome the challenges of each asana, creating a multi-dimensional, kinesthetic experience of the meditative power of the yantra. The goal is detailed in Patanjaliâ€™s Yoga Sutras: involution toward the bindu, the central point of stillness.",
