		"description": "Moon Salutations were developed in the early 1980s by four women at Kripalu Institute to balance the energy of traditional Sun Salutations. Moon Salutes tune into the reflective, intuitive energy of the moon focusing on hip and heart opening postures. Each posture is held for several seconds in order to allow the body to accept the energy of the practice. It is a mixed level practice that builds stamina of the body and mind. This 90-minute workshop combines the beautiful flow of Moon Salutations with healing yoga exercises, chanting meditations, candle gazing and deep relaxation. The entire workshop is supported with live guitar music by Rick Romanelli. Each month follows the theme of the full moon for that month with slight variations to the Moon Salutation, mantra and music. A perfect way to end your work week!",

Because, your breath, and the way you breathe it, is vital to the health of your entire physical being; and the state of your physical body directly influences your mental state. So, if the breath is vital to physical health, we can see that the breath is also vital to mental health. Join me for a discovery-based practice to become more consciously attuned to your unique breath. We'll explore our nature through self-inquiry, journaling, discussion of the anatomy and physics of breathing, discussion of various breathing patterns, all supplemented and guided by gentle flowing movement, static postures, and watching the breath in meditation.",
