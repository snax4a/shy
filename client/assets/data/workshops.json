Joni will assist you in setting up each pose, and will also teach you how to practice on your own, so you can experience this blissful state regularly! Please bring one or two thin blankets. Studio props are available for use, but are limited depending on the number of attendees. Register early, limit of 15 students.",

		"image": "/assets/images/workshops/shoulder.jpg",
		"description": "The shoulder girdle is the most mobile joint system in the body and thus is prone to overuse, tension, stiffness and injury. Without good mobility and strength in this system, we tend to slouch, lose strength and can suffer cyclical pain in the shoulders, mid-back, neck or wrists. Postural issues are some of the leading causes of poor shoulder girdle function. In this therapeutic workshop, Linda Meacci, an Experienced Registered Yoga Teacher, and Jamie DeMarco, a Doctor of Physical Therapy and yoga teacher, help you understand how to restore and maintain stability and pain-free movement. Physiological factors involved include the skeletal structure, muscles and soft tissue of the upper back, chest, shoulders and arms. Linda and Jamie show you how to rebalance the system from both a yoga and physical therapy point of view. They will address underlying issues&mdash;including the relationship between the shoulders, hips and spine&mdash;and give you practical tools to release physical and emotional tension. By identifying the muscle chains that stabilize the shoulders and becoming aware of simple movement that support the system, we can achieve a more upright posture and better function. This workshop is ideal for fellow yoga teachers, long-time yogis, new students and anyone plagued with shoulder, upper back or neck tension.",
