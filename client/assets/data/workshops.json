In this foundational training, Paula Soto, a licensed social worker and registered yoga teacher, and Linda Meacci, an experienced yoga-teacher-training instructor, will present a spectrum of information, ranging from how to create a non-harming atmosphere in yoga classes and private lessons, to recognizing and responding to nonverbal signs of stress and trauma in students/clients, to setting up yoga services for trauma-impacted populations. Rather than require teachers to veer from their own teaching styles, this training will equip them to apply trauma-informed insights to their established methods of instruction.
