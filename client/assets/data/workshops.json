		"description": "Moon Salutations were developed in the early 1980s by four women at Kripalu Institute to balance the energy of traditional Sun Salutations. Moon Salutes tune into the reflective, intuitive energy of the moon focusing on hip and heart opening postures. Each posture is held for several seconds in order to allow the body to accept the energy of the practice. It is a mixed-level practice that builds stamina of the body and mind. This 90-minute workshop combines the beautiful flow of Moon Salutations with healing yoga exercises, chanting meditations, candle gazing and deep relaxation. The entire workshop is supported with live guitar music by Rick Romanelli. A perfect way to end your work week!",

		"description": "As the integrity of any structure is contingent on its foundation, so it is with the function of our feet in relation to the rest of our bodies. Yet most of our society spends considerable time in footwear, and our minimal time barefoot results in disconnection from our crucial foundation. Our feet are one of the most nerve-dense parts of our bodies, and its 33 joints and 26 bones suggest that we have a great capacity for mobility, which is often unexplored, and for which a toll is taken on the rest of the body. Get grounded and explore the function of your foundation with this exciting and fascinating workshop all about the function of your feet, and enjoy the direct benefits up the chain.",

Caution: may lead to napping, snoring, and otherwise blissing out in yoga class . . . all of which is completely acceptable! Bring a journal if you'd like to record your thoughts and experiences.",
