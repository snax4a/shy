- /app/cart/cart.pug
  - Pass back payment gateway errors to the page
- Add indexes to Subscriber and Order tables
- /api/order
  - Break up the create() in server/api/order/order.controller.js
  - Handle promise to deal with success/failure of gateway.transaction.sale
  - Conditionally change /server/config/environment/index.js gateway.environment from Sandbox if production

Low/cosmetic
- Possibly take Transaction.creditCard.last4 from Braintree response
- Fix "after all" hook, TypeError: Cannot read property 'on' of undefined during npm test
  - mocha.global.js - maybe related to update of mocha
- Add a toast if there's an error with the contact dialog
- Decide if I want to retain order information for better reporting than provided by payment gateway
- Maybe update api/order/order.controller.js to use class instead
- Perhaps create tweet button via JavaScript instead so it lazily loads Twitter's code
- Consider wrapping main page's paragraphs in .col-md-6 so that they'll wrap
