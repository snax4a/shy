High
- /api/order
  - Process payment w/PayPal PayFlow Pro (npm install paypal-rest-sdk) or Braintree
- cartPage:
  - Disable PlaceOrder button once submitted
  - Pass back database and payment gateway errors to page

Low/cosmetic
- Maybe update api/order/order.controller.js to use class instead
- Perhaps create tweet button via JavaScript instead so it lazily loads Twitter's code
- Consider wrapping main page's paragraphs in .col-md-6 so that they'll wrap
