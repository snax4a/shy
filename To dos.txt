High
- Break up cart.service.js _postOrderInformation into 2 methods so I can chain results
- /app/cart/cart.pug
  - Modify callback of braintreeHostedFieldsCreate (cart.service.js) to set values we can track with ngMessages
  - Place Order button - disable if !this.Cart.clientInstance - also change form to payment
  - Pass back payment gateway errors to the page
- /api/order
  - Handle promise to deal with success/failure of gateway.transaction.sale
  - Change /server/config/environment/index.js gateway.environment from Sandbox

Low/cosmetic
- Fix "after all" hook, TypeError: Cannot read property 'on' of undefined during npm test
  - mocha.global.js - maybe related to update of mocha
- Add a toast if there's an error with the contact dialog
- Decide if I want to retain order information for better reporting than provided by payment gateway
- Maybe update api/order/order.controller.js to use class instead
- Perhaps create tweet button via JavaScript instead so it lazily loads Twitter's code
- Consider wrapping main page's paragraphs in .col-md-6 so that they'll wrap
