High
- cart.pug
  - If we get an error, make sure the Place Order button is re-enabled
  - Make sure if a successful order precedes a failure, that the failure is displayed properly

Low/cosmetic
- Fix "after all" hook, TypeError: Cannot read property 'on' of undefined during npm test
  - mocha.global.js - maybe related to update of mocha
- Add a toast if there's an error with the contact dialog
- Perhaps create tweet button via JavaScript instead so it lazily loads Twitter's code
- Consider wrapping main page's paragraphs in .col-md-6 so that they'll wrap
- Figure out why /client/app/cart/cart.component.js needed this.$timeout(() => this.pageName); to force a digest
